        Virtual reality (VR) headsets offer an immersive experience that can transport you to another world. When choosing a VR headset, consider these key factors:
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Resolution</h2>
      <p>
        Higher resolution provides a clearer and more detailed image, which enhances the overall experience. Look for headsets with high-resolution displays to reduce the screen-door effect.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Field of View</h2>
      <p>
        A wider field of view (FOV) increases immersion by filling more of your peripheral vision. Aim for a headset with a FOV of at least 100 degrees.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Comfort</h2>
      <p>
        Comfort is crucial for extended use. Look for adjustable straps, balanced weight distribution, and adequate padding. Some headsets also offer customizable fit options.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Tracking and Controllers</h2>
      <p>
        Accurate tracking and responsive controllers are essential for a smooth VR experience. Consider the tracking technology (e.g., inside-out, external sensors) and the ergonomics of the controllers.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Content and Compatibility</h2>
      <p>
        Ensure the headset is compatible with your gaming system or PC. Also, check the availability of content and games for the platform, as this can significantly impact your experience.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold my-2">Price</h2>
      <p>
        VR headsets vary in price, from budget options to high-end models. Determine your budget and find a headset that offers the best features and performance within that range.
